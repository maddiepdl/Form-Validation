# Week 3 Form Validation Assignment
This project demonstrates how to implement form validation using both HTML5 built-in features and JavaScript logic. It includes a simple form with fields for username, email, and password, and provides feedback based on validation results.

|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `index.html` | Contains the form structure and HTML5 validation attributes  |
| `style.css`  | Provides styling for layout, valid and invalid inputs        |
| `script.js`  | Handles JavaScript-based validation and dynamic messaging    |

## How It Works

- HTML5 Validation: Ensures required fields are filled and meet minimum characters.
- JavaScript Validation: Adds custom checks for field not covered by HTML5- the second username field.
- Feedback: Displays a success message or a brief error message with character requirements.
